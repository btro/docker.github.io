Docker Machine comes with [command completion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion)
for the bash and zsh shell.

## Installing Command Completion

### Bash

Make sure bash completion is installed. If you use a current Linux in a non-minimal installation, bash completion should be available.
On a Mac, install with `brew install bash-completion`

Place the completion script in `/etc/bash_completion.d/` (`` remove `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/`` on a Linux), using e.g.

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/master/contrib/completion/bash/docker > `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/docker

Completion will be available upon next login.


### Zsh

Place the completion scripts in your `/path/to/zsh/completion`, using e.g. `~/.zsh/completion/`

    mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
    curl -L https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/completion/zsh/_docker > ~/.zsh/completion/_docker-machine

Include the directory in your `$fpath`, e.g. by adding in `~/.zshrc`

    fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath)

Make sure `compinit` is loaded or do it by adding in `~/.zshrc`

    autoload -Uz compinit && compinit -i

Then reload your shell

    exec $SHELL -l
